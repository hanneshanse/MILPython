'''
This example shows the use of a decision variable that is not time dependent.
In this case the variable is beeing used for choosing which battery storage to use. 
This is beeing done by a decision variable 'bat_choice' in the battery class.
The different options and properties associated with the choice get passed by a dictionary in the following form:
{'bat1':{'price':1500,'e_max':200},
 'bat2':{'price':100,'e_max':50}}
The package automatically generates binary state variables for choosing between the options and continuous state variable for the different properties.
decisionVar.get_result() shwows the chosen option after the optimization as shown below.
